Geetest Captcha Crack - Source Code + Crack Manual
Description: Compared to the method of using selenium to automate the browser that is already available online, this method is more convenient, does not require the installation of additional modules, and only uses Python's native requests and lxml. In addition, the selenium method is too dependent on the browser, and if you are not careful, you will not get the desired movement.

Advantages over the selenium method are as follows:
  1. Easy to install, only requires Python or Anaconda;

  2. Does not rely on the browser, simulates packet requests, and is fast;

  3. Extremely high recognition rate (using verified trajectory data). I have also tried the selenium method, and even if the slider can be moved to the gap, in many cases it will be recognized as machine behavior by the remote server;

 4. Easy to manage, only requires verified trajectory data (trajectory data collection is also very convenient and can be updated regularly).

  (Documentation has been completed, but not yet published. Will be open-sourced at an appropriate time.)

2017.8.22 (Open source projects are only for technical sharing and self-summary. I didn't expect it to attract so much attention, and my mood is complicated. I hope everyone uses it for learning purposes only and not for commercial purposes. If it harms the interests of Geetest and the target website, it is not intentional. I will no longer provide technical guidance. The program is very simple, and Geetest can easily change the encryption method, which may cause it to fail. Please do not have high expectations. Also, I have been busy looking for a job recently and don't want to have any trouble. Please understand. Finally, web crawling is a technology, do not touch anything beyond the legal limit.)

Note
This tutorial + program is only applicable to Geetest 5.10.10. As of November 2017, Geetest has been updated to version 6.0, and this tutorial is no longer valid and is only for reference.
